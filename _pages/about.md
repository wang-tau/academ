I am a master's student in the [Faculty of Psychology at Southwest University](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/#), studying under [Assoc. Prof. Jianmin Zeng](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/info/1035/1478.htm), and I have obtained a master's degree in psychology. During my master's studies, I extensively reviewed the literature and actively conducted experiments. To date, I have published articles as the first author in the ***Journal of Psychiatric Research*** (JCR: Q1) and ***Behavioural Brain Research*** (JCR: Q2).

My research interests primarily include **Behavioural economics**, **Neuroeconomics**, **Decision-making**, **Meta-analysis**, and **Mental disorders**. I firmly believe in the saying: ["It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop."](https://ctext.org/analects/zi-han/zh?searchu=%E8%AD%AC%E5%A6%82%E5%B9%B3%E5%9C%B0%EF%BC%8C%E9%9B%96%E8%A6%86%E4%B8%80%E7%B0%A3%EF%BC%8C%E9%80%B2%EF%BC%8C%E5%90%BE%E5%BE%80%E4%B9%9F%E3%80%82)
